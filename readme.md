## Development

### Steps to Build the Project

#### 1. Set up and planning

- Create a new HTML file `index.html` and a CSS file `style.css`.
- Link the CSS file to the HTML document.
- Add basic HTML structure with dummy content.

#### 2. Gather assets

- Use images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) or placeholder images for your profile and background.
- Select Google Fonts (e.g., **Playfair Display** and **Roboto**).
- Download SVG icons from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com) and [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/).

#### 3. Build HTML Structure

- **Header Section**: Add a navigation bar and a hero section with your picture and introduction.
- **Projects Section**: Showcase your featured projects in a grid layout.
- **Contact Section**: Include your contact information and social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.).

#### 4. CSS Styling and Responsiveness

- **Desktop Layout**: Start by creating the desktop layout first. Style the header, project section, and contact section.
- **Media Queries**: Implement media queries for tablet and mobile screen sizes.

  - Example:

    ```css
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
      /* Tablet styles */
    }

    @media (max-width: 480px) {
      /* Mobile styles */
    }
    ```

#### 5. Test and Refine

- Test the design on multiple screen sizes using the browser's developer tools.
- Refine the design based on responsiveness and visual appearance.
